# Code Samples

The code samples are composed from:

## Sample 1

Code sample 1 contains 4 different solutions to solve the nbody problem:

1. Cuda straight forward implementation
  -  Spawning of a cuda thread for every body in the system
2. Cuda implementation that decreases computations from `O(N^2)` to `O(N^2/2)`
  -  Through sharing of computations and a further step for gathering of results
3. C++ threads implementation making use of a producer and multiple consumers.
  - The producer contains a list of tasks
  - The consumers will continue to consume tasks until signalled
  - Producer and Consumers operate in a lock-step fashion
4. OpenMP implementation
  - Makes use of the SSE3 instruction set for improved performance

## Sample 2

Code sample 2 contains the work of my Master's thesis, which involves the field of high-fidelity rendering, distributed systems, parallelism and distributed systems.

The code can be split into two; the rendering component and the communication component, as specified in the

## Compiling the Sources
To compile all the sources an environmental variable must be setup, specifying a directory containing the Boost Library

## Feedback
Any feedback on how to improve the code further would be greatly appreciated.
