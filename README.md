# Code Samples

The code samples are composed from:

## CodeSamples 1

CodeSamples 1 contains solutions for the N-Body problem in 4 different ways:

1. Cuda straight forward implementation
  -  Spawning of a thread for every body in the system
2. Cuda implementation that decreases computations from O(N^2) to O(N^2/2)
  -  Through sharing of computations and a further step for gathering of results
3. C++ threads implementation making use of a producer and multiple consumers.
  - The producer contains a list of tasks
  - The consumers will continue to consume tasks until signalled
4. OpenMP implementation that makes use of the SSE3 instruction set to improve the performance
